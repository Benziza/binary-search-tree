# binary-search-tree

## Introduction

A binary search tree is a binary tree that contains nodes and has the following properties:

1-The left branch of a node contains nodes that have keys with a value less than the key value of this node.<br>
2-The right branch of a node contains nodes that have keys with a value greater than the key value of this node.<br>
3-The left and right branch must also be binary search trees, and no nodes can be the same.<br>
<strong>Remark</strong> : These properties impose a special order of the elements in the binary data tree that depends on the value of the key, and as a result, the execution of searches and finds the minimum or maximum value is faster.<br>
